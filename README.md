#Monty Project


Monty 0.98 is a type of computer language. It works like Python, where code is turned into special codes. It uses a special way to organize information called a stack. The goal of this project is to make a program that can understand these special codes.

Monty code files

These files usually end with .m. Many people use this, but it's not needed. Each line has one instruction. There can be spaces before or after the instruction and its information.
